## Overview
The objective of this project is to perform EDA on the dataset and get Insights through Visualization with CRISP-DM.
The CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) can be summarised as:

1. Business Understanding  
2. Data Understanding  
3. Prepare Data  
4. Data Modeling  
5. Evaluate the Results  
6. Deploy  


We will follow below steps to do that:  
1. Pick a dataset  
2. Pose at atleast 5 questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.  
3. Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

4. Prepare data:Gather necessary data to answer your questions Handle categorical and missing data Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them Analyze, Model, and Visualize

5. Communicate your business insights through various graphs and tools like powerBI
